Overview of the proposed approach.(a) illustrates the training process of the proposed unsupervised anomaly detection approach, where Synomaly noise is utilized to corrupt the healthy image. (b) depicts the inference processs, in which Gaussian noise is applied directly to the anomalous images. Since the trained model has already been exposed to similar synthetic anomalies during training, it can efficiently erase the abnormalities. Multi-stage diffusion process is implemented to conserve fine details of the original image, thus increasing the anomaly detection accuracy.
